        <h2>What is Navbar?</h2>
        <p>
          A "navbar," short for "navigation bar," is a user interface element
          commonly found on websites and applications. Its primary purpose is to
          provide a navigational structure, allowing users to easily access
          different sections, pages, or features of a website or application.
          The navbar is typically located at the top of a webpage or screen,
          though it can also be positioned elsewhere depending on the design.

        <p>
          A sticky navbar refers to a navigation bar (navbar) on a webpage that
          remains fixed or "sticks" to the top of the viewport as the user
          scrolls down the page. This behavior ensures that the navigation menu
          is always visible, providing easy access to important links and
          sections of the website. To implement a sticky navbar, CSS positioning
          and JavaScript are often used. The CSS position: fixed;
